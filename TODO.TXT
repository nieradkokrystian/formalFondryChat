CHANGE MESSAGES LOGIC  messages.jsx

- Improve the tag generation. 

- The whole logic on sensing what is "code" and what isn't is really risky. It uses .include("keyword"). in case the keyword ever changes, there might be problem with code generation.


WORKSPACE:

- need to move css files to styles folder, rewrite every pathname that will break


chat.jsx add a filter
- make a limit of last hundred messages shown. Perhaps a checkbox or whatnot. the mobile doesnt concern me as of yet, and if it does, tailwind makes it easy to set up. 

COLOR PALLETE: app.css

- will I even get one? This is a question... You can define colors in App.css using @theme taliwind namepsace. Visit tailwind docs for more details. 

DOCS: 

--Have fun making it responsive. Made with tailwind, so it should be fairly simple. No time to fix. 
--make the sidebar an extendable, perhaps a button or a "peeking" sidebar(only a bit of it visible and expanded on click)

CLEAR CONSOLE LOGS -- TOO LAZY
