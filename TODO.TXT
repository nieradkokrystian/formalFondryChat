CHANGE MESSAGES LOGIC  messages.jsx

- Improve the tag generationhandling. 

- The whole logic on sensing what is "code" and what isn't is really risky. It uses .include("keyword"). in case the keyword ever changes, there might be problem with code generation.


WORKSPACE:

- need to move css files to styles folder, rewrite every pathname that will break
- maybe change component names? Segregate them? 
- move the animations/textype to src/animations
- In case something doesn't work, and empty chat is displayed, make empty chat better (currently, it's nothing more than a placeholder)


chat.jsx add a filter
- make a limit of last hundred messages shown. Perhaps a checkbox or whatnot. the mobile doesnt concern me as of yet, and if it does, tailwind makes it easy to set up. 

COLOR PALLETE: app.css

- will I even get one? This is a question... You can define colors in App.css using @theme taliwind namepsace. Visit tailwind docs for more details. 

DOCS: 

--Have fun making it responsive. Made with tailwind, so it should be fairly simple. No time to fix. 
--make the sidebar an extendable, perhaps a button or a "peeking" sidebar(only a bit of it visible and expanded on click)
!!! The entire page works by passing down an erlier created component e.g. "Introduction.mdx" to the Docs.jsx component in <Routes> in App.jsx. The "page" prop receives the component. !!!

-perhaps make the routes auto generate? like one big JSON from which we read the paths? or use Routes.js i created to store the additional routes in an object and export it into app.jsx to generate them dynamically? 

CLEAR CONSOLE LOGS -- TOO LAZY

SCROLLING MECHANIC IN CHAT.jsx  perhaps done lareayd? review

THE VIEW WITH TABLE-LIKE DATA ON TASKS? Api with taskname perhaps?

YOU CAN ADD ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS INTO ConponentsMdx.jsx to improve the doc-making components and add new functionality. Make it responsive, while you're at it, mysterious successor:) 

WEBSITE:
--add all the aria stuff and accessibility . 
-- add better auth checks

ADMIN PANEL:
admin/326483545732548981349134gfjkdgf4783gf7ig437fg437fg437f64gf874fgohurghdf78gdft7gfd87ogoftd67

- Allow Cors In user creation. can't check cuz Cors, eventually debug if you're at it. (go to krystian)
- DIsable navbar displaying when admin panel in on. 
- Make the admin panel available only when user is an admin? (perhaps /auth API returning isAdmin : true )
- the admin panel is only a makeshift one. [I'm really doing this on my last day.]
- fill the missing bento. 
- 

SIDEBAR.JSX:

-the terms of service and all are only placehoders, do what you want with them.
- you can align the "My Tasks" h1 element to match the navbar's height for aesthetics.


REWORK EVERYTHING If WEBSOCKETs EVER APPEAR 


INPUTCOMPONENT.JSX 

- FIT BOTH ENV INFO AND LAST HUNDRED MESSAGES CHECKBOX somewhere where it looks good (currently it glaring)




DOCS.JSX:
